        <p>Hello! My name is Fabiana Moya and I am from Salta, Argentina. I love learning and discovering new things
            every day. Currently, I`m studying Software Development at BYU, a choice that
            inspires me because it combines my curiosity for technology with the creativity to build solutions that make
            people's
            lives easier. I'm a mother of three, which has taught me to prioritize, plan, and be resilient. In my free
            time, I enjoy
            singing and
            spending time with friends and family; these experiences recharge me and remind me of the importance of
            enjoying every
            moment. </p>
