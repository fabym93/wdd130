            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Thunderfalls White Water was born from the vision of two friends passionate about adventure and rafting
                excursions. In
                2010, after a whitewater expedition, they realized that extreme experiences could go hand in hand with
                environmental
                responsibility. They decided to combine their love of nature with engineering reliable equipment and
                founded
                Thunderfalls White Water with the mission of organizing and coordinating safe and memorable rafting
                excursions for
                explorers of all levels. With a small operations center by the river and the support of experienced
                guides, the company
                grew thanks to innovation in logistics, ongoing training, and a strong aquatic ecosystem conservation
                program. Today,
                Thunderfalls White Water continues to expand its rafting routes, maintaining its spirit of adventure and
                environmental
                commitment, and accompanying each group on journeys that connect communities, rivers, and unforgettable
                emotions..</p>
